Force, Difficulty 5/10

Some contracts will simply not take your money ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The goal of this level is to make the balance of the contract greater than zero.

Things that might help:
-Fallback methods
-Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.
-See the Help page above, section "Beyond the console"
